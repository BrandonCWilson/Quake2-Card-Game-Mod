When an enemy spots you, you'll enter a battle.
Use the scroll wheel to cycle through the cards in your hand.
Press the left mouse button when you are ready to use the selected card, which should be higher than the other bottom 3 cards in the UI.
The enemy always chooses their card before you do. Cards will be resolved only when you have chosen yours.
If an entity's deck is empty, they will draw "Hijack" cards by default.
The battle ends when either you or your opponent's HP hit 0 or lower. If you win, you'll be rewarded a few random non-bite cards.
